# 27.-CodeBuddy-Streamlit-Website
This Github repository is my official submission for the [Devpost](https://devpost.com/) hackathon titled: '[RAG 'n' ROLL Amp up Search with Snowflake & Mistral Hackathon](https://snowflake-mistral-rag.devpost.com/)'. However, since my submission requires the deployment of 2 different applications, a Streamlit website (deployed using Streamlit Cloud) and a Telegram Bot (deployed using Vercel), I had to use 2 seperate Github repositories. Since according to the rules of the [RAG 'n' ROLL Amp up Search with Snowflake & Mistral Hackathon](https://snowflake-mistral-rag.devpost.com/), it requires the submission of a Streamlit website link and the Github repository hosting that Streamlit website, I decided to submit this Github repository as my official submission instead, while adding the main codes for the Telegram Bot in the folder '[telegram bot codes](https://github.com/WindJammer6/27.-CodeBuddy-Streamlit-Website/tree/main/telegram%20bot%20codes)'. You can see the Github repository hosting the Telegram Bot here: https://github.com/WindJammer6/26.-CodeBuddy.

From the [RAG 'n' ROLL Amp up Search with Snowflake & Mistral official website](https://snowflake-mistral-rag.devpost.com/): 'This hackathon is an opportunity to riff with cutting-edge AI technology. Join us and get comfortable with a setlist for learning AI with Cortex Search for retrieval, Mistral LLM (mistral-large2) on Snowflake Cortex for generation, and Streamlit Community Cloud for the front end.'

The challenge of this hackathon was to create an innovative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications that can revolutionize how we interact with information using [Snowflake's Cortex Search](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview) for retrieval, [Mistral LLM (mistral-large2)](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-large-2407/) on [Snowflake's Cortex Search](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview) for generation and [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) for front end.
